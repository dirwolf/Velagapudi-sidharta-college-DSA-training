Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) - Course Content
Course Overview
This repository contains the course content for an Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course that I taught to students at Velgapudi Ramakrishna College, Vijayawada. The course covered essential topics such as Dynamic Programming (DP), Recursion, and Graph Algorithms.

Throughout the course, I shared various coding problems and conceptual explanations with the students, helping them build a deeper understanding of these advanced topics.

Course Topics
The course focused on the following key areas:

Dynamic Programming (DP): Techniques and approaches for solving problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and using previously computed results to solve larger problems.
Recursion: Understanding recursive problem-solving, including base cases, recursive calls, and efficient implementation techniques.
Graphs: Introduction to graph theory and graph algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and shortest path algorithms, with practical coding examples.
Repository Contents
In this repository, you'll find the Google Sheets link to the collection of problems I taught during the course. The sheet contains:

Problem Statements: A list of problems with detailed descriptions.
Solutions: A variety of approaches and algorithms used to solve each problem.
Additional Resources: Links to external resources or reference materials, if available.
